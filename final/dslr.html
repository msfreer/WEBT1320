        <p class="text">DSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) cameras are one of the most versatile and powerful camera types available. These cameras use a mirror and prism system to reflect light 
            into an optical viewfinder, allowing photographers to see exactly what the lens sees. Unlike point-and-shoot and bridge cameras, DSLRs have interchangeable lenses, giving photographers 
            the flexibility to switch between wide-angle, telephoto, macro, and prime lenses depending on their needs.</p>

        <p class="text">One of the main advantages of DSLRs is their large image sensors, which provide superior image quality, better low-light performance, and more background blur (bokeh). 
            These cameras also feature fast autofocus systems, high-speed continuous shooting, and full manual controls, making them a favorite among professionals and serious enthusiasts.</p>

        <p class="text">While DSLRs offer exceptional image quality and creative control, they are often bulky and require a learning curve. However, entry-level models provide beginner-friendly 
            automatic modes, making them accessible for those looking to step up their photography skills. DSLRs remain a top choice for portrait, landscape, sports, and studio photography due to 
            their high performance and adaptability.</p>
