                <p class="text">Grand Junction Station serves as the primary hub of the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum. The Depot was built in 1984 by the museum due to a need for a larger space, as 
                the East Chattanooga Depot was too small. Located in Chattanooga, this station is where most excursions begin. It features a ticket office, gift shop, and a small museum showcasing 
                railroad artifacts. Visitors can explore historic railcars and board trains for various scenic excursions. Grand Junction is a bustling center for rail enthusiasts and a great place 
                to experience the nostalgia of train travel.</p>

                 place to rest. Located on the western side of the railroad, it offers visitors a chance to witness the turntable and locomotive maintenance facilities. This station is where steam 
                 engines are turned and serviced, giving passengers a behind-the-scenes look at the intricate workings of the railroad. It is also home to the restoration shops, making it an 
                 essential destination for those interested in railway preservation.</p>
