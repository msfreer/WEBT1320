            <h3>Built 1917 Baltimore & Ohio Railroad | TNVR 98</h3>

            <p class="text">TVRM car 98, the "Eden Isle", is a beautifully restored private railcar offering a luxurious experience for Tennessee Valley Railroad guests. Originally built in 1917 for the 
                Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, this elegant car features classic wood-paneled interiors, plush seating, and exquisite detailing that transports passengers to the golden age of rail travel. 
                The 98 was given the name "Eden Isle" in the 1970s once painted into the now iconic Tennessee Valley paint scheme. The car joined TNVR's diner car "Travelers Fare" in excursion service
                until 2019 when an extensive overhaul occured. The car returned in 2024 sporting an original B&O blue and gray scheme. Used for special events and private charters, the Eden Isle
                 provides an exclusive and comfortable journey for those looking to experience historic railroading in style. This car is particularly special to me as it brought up the rear of my parent's 
                wedding reception train, "The Freer Flyer", in 1992.</p></section>

            <h3>Built 1920 Pullman Company | TNVR 97</h3>

            <img class="image" src="images/TVRM_97.jpg" alt="TVRM 97">

            <p class="text">The "Clover Colony" is a beautifully restored 1920 Pullman sleeping car, offering a glimpse into the golden age of train travel. Originally built with a 12-1 configuration, 
                it was later modified to an 8-5 layout, featuring both open sections and private bedrooms, showcasing the luxury and comfort of Pullman's premier service.  Adding to its 
                historical significance, the Clover Colony starred in the classic 1959 film "Some Like It Hot."  Acquired by the TVRM in 1993, the car has been meticulously restored and 
                now provides passengers with a unique, time-capsule experience on special excursions, complete with 1940s d√©cor, evoking memories of elegant dining and leisurely travel. TVRM 
                numbered the car 97 to match alongside the 98, as the car never has an official number in service. The Clover Colony stands as a testament to the bygone era of luxurious rail 
                travel and a highlight of the TVRM's collection.</p></aside>
